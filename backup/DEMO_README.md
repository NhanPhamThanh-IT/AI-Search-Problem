## How to Run

### Option 1: Use the Launcher (Recommended)

```bash
cd src
python demo_launcher.py
```

### Option 2: Run Individual Demos

```bash
cd src

# GUI Demo
python gui_demo_rushhour.py

# Interactive Demo
python interactive_demo_rushhour.py

# Original Demo
python demo_rushhour.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pygame (for GUI demo only)

Install pygame:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Puzzle Description

The demo uses a 6x6 Rush Hour puzzle with:

- **Vehicle X** (red) - Target vehicle that needs to reach the exit
- **Vehicles A-G** - Blocking vehicles of various sizes
- **Goal** - Move vehicle X to the right edge (exit)

## Algorithms Tested

1. **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** - Optimal solution, explores level by level
2. **DFS (Depth-First Search)** - May find longer solutions, explores deeply first
3. **UCS (Uniform Cost Search)** - Optimal solution, considers move costs
4. **A\*** - Optimal solution with heuristic guidance, usually fastest

## Tips

- The GUI demo provides the best visual experience
- Interactive demo is great for understanding the puzzle mechanics
- Try manual solving mode to appreciate the algorithm's efficiency
- Compare algorithm performance to see the differences
